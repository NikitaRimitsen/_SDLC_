            <h5 class="card-title">BBD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Design-Driven Development</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">DDD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">SBD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure. Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">TDD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">ATDD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Acceptance test–driven development is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example, behavior-driven development, example-driven development, and support-driven development also called story test–driven development.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">CTDD</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Continuous test-driven development is a software development practice that extends test-driven development by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Specification by example</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Specification by example is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Data-Driven Development</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In computer programming, data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.[1] Standard examples of data-driven languages are the text-processing languages sed and AWK, where the data is a sequence of lines in an input stream – these are thus also known as line-oriented languages – and pattern matching is primarily done via regular expressions or line numbers. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Data-Oriented Design</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In essence, data-oriented design is the practice of designing software by developing transforms for well formed data where well formed is guided by the target hardware and the transforms that will operate on it.</p>
