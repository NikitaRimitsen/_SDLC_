    <div>
        1.Behavior-driven development (BDD)
        <p>This is a development based on the description of behavior. That is, there is a special person (or people) who writes descriptions like "I, as a user, want when the start button was pressed, then the menu was shown as in the picture." (there are specially highlighted keywords there).</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        2.Design-driven development (DDD)
        <p>Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        3.Domain-driven design (DDD)
        <p>This is an approach that aims to study the subject area of the enterprise as a whole or some individual business processes. This is an excellent approach for projects in which the complexity (entanglement) of business logic is quite large. Its application is designed to reduce this complexity as much as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        4.Secure by design (SD)
        <p>in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.

        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        5.Test-driven development (TDD)
        <p>This is a software development methodology that is based on the repetition of short development cycles: initially, a test is written covering the desired change, then a program code is written that implements the desired behavior of the system and will allow you to pass the written test, and then the written code is refactored with constant verification of passing all tests.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        6.Acceptance test-driven development
        <p>is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE), behavior-driven development (BDD), example-driven development (EDD), and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        7.Continuous test-driven development
        <p>is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        8.Specialization by example
        <p> is a business practice that involves focusing on specific products to help a company gain a competitive advantage and become an industry leader. If your company is interested in specialization, it's important to understand how it works and how you can implement it in your business.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        9.Data-driven development
        <p>It is a method or even a programming paradigm in which the program code, although separated from the input data, is designed in such a way that the logic of the program is determined by the input data. In a data-driven program, some or even all of its properties are set at runtime, which is especially important if the program is compiled by the user or must be modified by him without recompilation.

            Program operators can describe data samples (templates) and their corresponding processing rules, rather than a specific sequence of steps taken, as it happens in the AWK language.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        10.Data-oriented design (DOD)
        <p> is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used in video game development. The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. Proponents include Mike Acton, Scott Meyers, and Jonathan Blow.

            The parallel array (or structure of arrays) is the main example of data-oriented design. It is contrasted with the array of structures typical of object-oriented design. </p>
